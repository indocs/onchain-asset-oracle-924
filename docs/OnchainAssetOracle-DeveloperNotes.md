# OnchainAssetOracle - Developer Notes

This repository contains a small on-chain asset price oracle with access control. The tests cover basic access restrictions and no-op behavior.

Usage overview:

- Contracts:
  - OnchainAssetOracle.sol: Core oracle logic with access controls for updating assets.
  - CounterGuard.sol: Lightweight guard used in tests to simulate access control patterns.
  - ContractUtils.sol: Utility helpers used by contracts.

- Tests:
  - test/OnchainAssetOracle-access-control.test.ts
  - test/OnchainAssetOracle-noop.test.ts
  - test/OnchainAssetOracle.test.ts

- Deployment:
  - scripts/deploy.ts demonstrates deploying the contracts to a local Hardhat network.

Recommendations for contributors:

- Extend tests to cover edge cases: non-existent assets, large price values, and replay protection if applicable.
- Consider adding an event emission for asset updates if not already present, to improve off-chain monitoring.
- Keep functions small and well-documented; prefer explicit access checks.

Notes:
- Ensure Solidity compilation passes with the configured compiler version in hardhat.config.ts.
- All tests should run with npm test or npx hardhat test.
